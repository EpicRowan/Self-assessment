# Write a function that returns the total cost of something by applying
# taxes and fees of various states.

# States will be given as their two-letter abbreviations. For example,
# California's abbreviation is 'CA'.

# There are some states with special fees. All fees should be added to the new
# subtotal *after* tax:
#     - CA (California): add a 3% (0.03) tax for recycling
#     - PA (Pennsylvania): add $2.00 safety fee
#     - MA (Massachusettes):
#         - add $1.00 for items with a base price of $100.00 or less

# Arguments:
#     - Base price (int)
#     - Two-letter state abbreviation (str)
#     - Tax percentage as a decimal (optional, float)
#         - If a tax percentage is not given, it defaults to 0.05 (or 5%)

# """PROMPT 7

# Write a function that takes in a list and *any* number of additional arguments.
# The function should add all those items to the end of the  list and return
# the list.

# We haven't taught you how to do this! You'll need to do some research on your
# own --- find a way to write a Python function that can take in an arbitrary
# amount of arguments.

# Arguments:
#     - A list (list)
#     - Additional args

# Return:
#     - A list with arguments added to the end (list)
# """

# # Write your function here


# """PROMPT 8

# Write a function that takes in a word and returns a tuple. You'll do this in an
# interesting way though, so make sure you read these directions thoroughly.

# The tuple will contain two items:
#     - The given word
#     - The given word, multiplied 3 times

# To do this, your function will create an *inner* function. The *inner*
# function will multiply the given word by 3 and return it.

# Then, the outer function will call the *inner* function to create a tuple.

# Examples:
#     - 'hi' -> ('hi', 'hihihi')

# Arguments:
#     - A word (str)

# Return:
#     - (word, wordx3) (tuple)
